#### Ceph
A replicated service in a distributed system (like Ceph) achieves fault tolerance
by storing complete copies of its state (i.e., data) on multiple replica servers.
Replication allows the service to continue operating
even if some of its servers experience failures (crashes or a broken or flaky network).
