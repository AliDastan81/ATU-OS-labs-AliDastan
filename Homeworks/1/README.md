## Linux
This homework includes three problems. You can read about each question in the `README.md`
in each designated directory. The solutions should be in a `.sh` file, each submitted
in the corresponding directory.

#### Note
You are free to use `fish`, `zsh`, `bash`, or write a POSIX-compliant script if you want to.
